# :clock4: BTime 
*Never be late*

[Under development]

**BTime** is your new personal command line assistant that manages all your personal daily and weekly reminders.

Sounds fancy, but under the hood, it's just a python script that helps you schedule and manage more efficiently your **cron** time-based Unix-like tasks. 

# Installation
First, make sure you have git installed.
